# Smart Scheduler

Set the `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable if you want booking confirmations
sent to an additional address. If unset, notifications are sent to
`corvette052@gmail.com` by default.

Each appointment blocks out two and a half hours which accounts for both the
1.5‑hour tinting job and an additional hour of travel time. For example, a
booking at **10:00 AM** will make **12:30 PM** the next available slot.
